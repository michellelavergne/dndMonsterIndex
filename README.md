# The Dungeons and Dragons Monster Index
I am creating a 5e monster index for all the DMs in my life. Please note that this project is VERY MUCH a work-in-progress.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DnD API

The idea is to have a user enter a monster name and the API serves up all the info on the monster to the DOM. 

## Optimizations

Like I said, this is very much a work-in-progress and I'm actively still trying to work out parsing the json and then printing it to the DOM. After I've successfully done that, I'll style the app with CSS. As far as I can tell, the API doesn't serve up images of the monsters themselves, so I need to find a way to add their images as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I'm still learning about parsing data and connecting everything on the back-end.
